the child plays in the early morning
they talks while humming a tune
the boy laughs
the team runs at the station before the day ends
the teacher runs as the wind blows
the child writes
the driver laughs near the river while thinking about the past
the teacher laughs at the park
my friend smiles
my friend listens because it feels peaceful
the artist dreams
the teacher cries because it feels peaceful
the teacher listens
we smiles as the city wakes up
the child sits at the beach after a long time
the child walks after a long time
our neighbor works near the river
you works
they writes
we reads before going home
the driver smiles in the garden while thinking about the past
they sits on the hill while humming a tune
my friend drinks at the door
they reads at the park
the cat dreams in the forest
i reads in the field
the worker looks at school
the artist dreams as the city wakes up
the girl sits
the child stands
the team talks near the river
the cat reads when the sun rises
